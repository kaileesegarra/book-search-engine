## Description

The Book Search Engine application allows avid readers to search for books using the Google Books API, but also manage their personal book lists or libraries. The app has been refactored from a RESTful API to use a GraphQL API with Apollo Server. Built with the MERN stack, it includes a React front end, MongoDB database, and Node.js/Express.js server.
