# Book Search Engine

## Description

The Book Search Engine application allows users to search for books using the Google Books API and manage their book lists. The app has been refactored from a RESTful API to use a GraphQL API with Apollo Server. Built with the MERN stack, it includes a React front end, MongoDB database, and Node.js/Express.js server.
